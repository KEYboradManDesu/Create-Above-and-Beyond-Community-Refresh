## Create: Above and Beyond 1.20.1 Community Refreshed version

This is a modpack based on **Create: Above and Beyond (CAB)** and **[CABF] Cabricality**, running on **Forge 1.20.1**. This modpack resets and implements the entire game process inspired by Create: Above and Beyond. We welcome every challenger and sincerely hope you enjoy the world of Minecraft!

Here, you can follow the guidance of tasks and build your own factory using Create and mainstream tech mods! From wandering in the valleys to traveling in space stations, the possibilities of technological development are up to you! There are about 50 mechanical devices between you and the moon. Thousands of machines and parts will be sent into the ever-growing automated factory, wishing you to explore the next level of technology.

Each step towards space is different, and some steps even vary depending on the world seed.

Tired of repetitive labor? Earn coins from various chores or professions of your choice. Automate the trading process or gather other players to help you complete tasks. You can then buy various resources, treasures, and building blocks from the market.

### Discover New Challenges

After a slow and exciting early stage, the pace of development begins to accelerate as the first major product is fully automated. Interwoven conveyor networks, mixing and washing crystals, controlling explosions, dyeing material changes, firing lasers at minecarts, tinkering with digits, and other novel automation tasks await your challenge.

As an additional content, chemical research and transmutation can lead you to discover the secret recipes unique to your world seed!

### Trade and Specialization

A variety of items can be bought and sold, which is a significant game-changing mechanism in the modpack. Choosing a profession and completing chores will allow you to buy your preferred resources instead of doing tedious work. The trading mechanism can be accessed through the task interface and allows for intricate automation.

### Extra Efforts

The modpack adds a large number of blocks, items, and fluids, as well as custom scripts that provide new interactions between machines and materials. Additionally, some mods have received new textures to make them more cohesive overall.
